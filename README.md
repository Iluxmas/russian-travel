# Project: Russian travel

Project theme was russian travel, template was taken from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5S2WSbEFL6awjVWJ0NWL8Q/Sprint-3_-Russia-_-desktop-mobile?node-id=28503%3A0).
Page is adaptive, size and position of elements depends on screen size through media queries. Grid and flex both were used.
For styles SCSS was used with further conversion to css.
Have some plans to add switcher Light\Dark theme via JS.
